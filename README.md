# Blue Bike Transaction Management System


**Introduction:**

Got an opportunity to work on a prototype of a Transaction management system with real life functionality. A Bluebike management database system will manage all areas of the application including customer registration, wallet setup, employee, and customer service functions. With its flexibility, power and easy-to-use properties, it is designed to meet needs of customers and employees both.

**Business Objective:**

1) Boosting the application with better database design for a better user experience, ensuring higher user retention.
2) To develop an automated system that processes customer information, bike rides, payments, and customer service quickly, securely and patiently.
3) To store customer information, wallets, bike information, docking station availability, employee workflow.
4) To minimize the bike ride charges
5) To provide top tier bike renting services and better coordination between different departments.

Please refer to Project Report attached in the repository to see the Assumptions, Flow Charts, ER Diagram, Entity Tables. Security Rules and View Tables. 

Repository contains the various scripts to create the environment with all tables and roles, data tests to confirm correct functioning of the designed transaction flow including Deadlock checks, and data security.
